# FastMCP Cloud Deployment Guide

## Overview
FastMCP Cloud is a managed platform for deploying MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, including our GIMP MCP Server. It's the official hosting solution from the FastMCP team.

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- GitHub repository with your FastMCP server code
- Python file containing a FastMCP server instance

## Deployment Steps

1. **Access FastMCP Cloud**
   - Visit [fastmcp.cloud](https://fastmcp.cloud)
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Create a New Project**
   - Click "Create Project"
   - Choose between:
     - Connecting an existing repository
     - Using the FastMCP Cloud quickstart

3. **Configure Project Settings**
   - **Name**: Project name (used in URL)
   - **Entrypoint**: Python file and server object (e.g., `main.py:app`)
   - **Authentication**: Public or organization-only access

4. **Automatic Deployment**
   - FastMCP Cloud will:
     - Detect dependencies from `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`
     - Build and deploy your server
     - Provide a public URL for access

## GIMP MCP Server Considerations
- Ensure all GIMP dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`
- The server should be configured to run in HTTP mode
- Environment variables can be set in the project settings
- Check logs through the FastMCP Cloud dashboard

## Best Practices
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper error handling
- Monitor resource usage
- Set up CI/CD for automated deployments

## Troubleshooting
- Check build logs in the dashboard
- Verify all dependencies are specified
- Ensure the entrypoint is correctly formatted as `filename:object`
- Contact FastMCP support for platform-specific issues
